<h2>Xin chào các bạn!</h2>
      
<p>Tiếng Việt for Travellers is a language learning website created for travellers looking to gain some basic knowledge of Vietnamese. Whilst the website might be aimed at travellers, it is by all means accessible to anyone with an interest in learning the language. The crash course has been divided into five units, with each unit corresponding to a day in the country: 
 
 <ul>
   <li><strong><a href="https://joy-ly.github.io/day_1.html">Day 1: Basics</a></strong></li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://joy-ly.github.io/day_2.html">Day 2: Travel</a></strong></li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://joy-ly.github.io/day_3.html">Day 3: Shopping</a></strong></li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://joy-ly.github.io/day_4.html">Day 4: Emergencies</a></strong></li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://joy-ly.github.io/day_5.html">Day 5: Eating</a></strong></li>
        </ul>
  
<h3>How to use this course </h3>
      
<p>In order to accommodate for every kind of learner, you will find that this website uses a wide variety of teaching methods.</p>

      <p><strong>Conversations</strong> To show how the language is used in a given situation.</p>
      <p><strong>Vocabulary</strong> To provide the necessary words and phrases. </p>
      <p><strong>Grammatical points</strong> To explain how particular words are used so that the rules can be applied to any situation</p>
      <p><strong>Acitivites</strong> To reinforce the learning process and make the content more fun and engaging.</p>
      <p><strong>Videos</strong> To allow learners to build the connection between acquired knowledge and its practical implementation in the real world.</p>
      
<h3>Got a minute?</h3>

<p>Vietnamese is both an isolating and a tonal language. It is isolating because suffixes are not added to words to change their meaning. It is tonal because the same words can have various different meanings depending on whether they are spoken with a rising, falling or flat tone - or even a combination of tones! </p>
